# qase-pytest 6.1.0b4

## What's new

- the decorator `qase.id()` supports specifying multiple IDs.

    ```python
    @qase.id([2,3])
    def test_example():
        pass
    ```

- if you use the `testops` mode and specify a plan ID then the reporter will run the tests specified in the test plan
  based on their IDs.
- exclude the default parameters that are added by additional libraries and start with `__pytest`
